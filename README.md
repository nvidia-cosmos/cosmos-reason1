### [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15558) | [Website](https://research.nvidia.com/labs/dir/cosmos-reason1/) | [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/collections/nvidia/cosmos-reason1-67c9e926206426008f1da1b7)

Cosmos-Reason1 is a suite of models, ontologies, and benchmarks that we develop with the goal of enabling multimodal LLMs to generate physically grounded responses. We release one multimodal LLMs: Cosmos-Reason1-7B post-trained with Physical AI SFT, and Physical AI reinforcement learning. We define ontologies for physical common sense and embodied reasoning, and also build benchmarks to evaluate Physical AI reasoning capabilities of multimodal LLMs.

## News
* 2025-06-11: We enhance the modelâ€™s capability on judging the physical plausibility of a video. See [this tutorial](https://github.com/nvidia-cosmos/cosmos-reason1/blob/main/examples/video_critic.md) for details.
* 2025-05-17: We release model weights and training data under [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/collections/nvidia/cosmos-reason1-67c9e926206426008f1da1b7).

Okay, let's see. The user is asking if it's safe to turn right based on the video provided. First, I need to ...
The key points here are the parked vehicles. There are cars parked on both sides of the road, ...

Based on the video, turning right may not be entirely safe due to the following factors: ...

## Post-Training

The [nvidia-cosmos/cosmos-rl](https://github.com/nvidia-cosmos/cosmos-rl)  repository is an async post-training framework specialized for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF). It prioritizes performance, scalability, and fault tolerance.

For detailed instructions on running SFT and PPO training, please refer to our [User Guide](docs/UserGuide.md).
