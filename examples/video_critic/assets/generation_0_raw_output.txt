<overview>
The video showcases a robotic setup involving two robotic arms positioned on either side of a wooden table. On the table, there are three primary objects: an orange bottle, a yellow bottle, and a red packet. A barcode scanner lies on the right side of the table. The video captures the robotic arms interacting with these items, specifically attempting to manipulate the bottles.
</overview>

<component name="Robotic Arm 1 (Left Side)">
<analysis>
Robotic Arm 1 is located on the left side of the frame. It has a mechanical design with joints and a claw-like gripper at its end. The arm moves smoothly and appears to be under control. There are no visible anomalies or artifacts related to Robotic Arm 1. Its movements are consistent with its intended function, showing smooth joint articulation and appropriate force application when gripping the orange bottle.

<component name="Robotic Arm 2 (Right Side)">
<analysis>
Robotic Arm 2 is on the right side of the frame. Similar in design to Robotic Arm 1, it features a mechanical structure with a gripper. Initially, the arm operates normally but exhibits a glitch near the end of the sequence. Specifically, the arm's gripper makes contact with the yellow bottle, but instead of gripping it cleanly, the bottle seems to pass partially through the gripper, as though the grip isn’t properly maintained. This suggests an anomaly in the interaction mechanics between the gripper and the bottle.

<component name="Orange Bottle">
<analysis>
The orange bottle is placed near the center-left of the table. It is transparent with an orange liquid inside and has a cap. The orange bottle interacts correctly with Robotic Arm 1 when it is lifted. However, toward the end of the video, when Robotic Arm 2 attempts to pick up the bottle, there is an issue where the bottle appears to pass through the gripper mechanism of Robotic Arm 2. This penetration violates physical realism, as solid objects cannot occupy the same space simultaneously. This is a clear artifact indicating a failure in the collision detection system of the simulation or software controlling the robotic arms.

<anomaly>Yes</anomaly>
</component>

<component name="Yellow Bottle">
<analysis>
The yellow bottle is situated near the center-right of the table. Like the orange bottle, it is transparent with a yellow liquid and capped. The yellow bottle is involved in the second interaction with Robotic Arm 2. Here, another instance of penetration occurs when the gripper attempts to pick up the bottle. The bottle’s body intersects with the gripper, defying the expected behavior of solid objects. This reinforces the presence of an artifact in the interaction logic.
</analysis>
<anomaly>Yes</anomaly>
</component>

<component name="Red Packet">
<analysis>
A small red packet is located behind the bottles. It appears to contain some items inside. The red packet remains stationary throughout the video. There are no visible anomalies associated with it; it does not interact with any other objects or exhibit any unexpected behaviors.
</analysis>
<anomaly>No</anomaly>
</component>

<component name="Barcode Scanner">
<analysis>
A handheld barcode scanner rests on the right side of the table. It is black and positioned next to Robotic Arm 2. The barcode scanner remains static and does not play a role in the interactions. No anomalies are observed regarding its position or state.
